# About
this project is a practice and showcase project of different kinds of DSL(Domain Specific Language) in python

# Method Chaining or Fluent Interfaces: 
As shown in the previous examples, you can use method chaining to create a DSL-like interface. This approach is simple and effective for creating DSLs for specific tasks or domains.

# Domain-Specific Base Classes: 
You can define base classes that provide DSL-like methods and then subclass them to create domain-specific classes. This approach can be more flexible and allows for more complex DSLs.

# Internal DSLs with Function Decorators:
Python's function decorators can be used to create internal DSLs that modify the behavior of functions. This approach is often used in libraries like Flask for defining routes.

# External DSLs with Parsing Libraries:
For more complex DSLs, you can use parsing libraries like PLY or ANTLR to create external DSLs with their own syntax and grammar. These libraries allow you to define custom parsers for your DSL.

# Third-Party Libraries:
There are also third-party libraries like PyDSL or Pyleri that provide tools for creating DSLs in Python. These libraries can simplify the process of creating DSLs and provide additional features for managing and executing DSL code.
